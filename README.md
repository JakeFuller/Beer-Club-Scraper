This project is a CLI application that parses URLs and queries the [Untappd API](https://untappd.com/api/docs) to fetch information for specific beers. This information is then uploaded to a MongoDB database (now offline) for storage and retrieval for my [Beer Club Website](https://github.com/JakeFuller/BeerClub)

This project has been sunset. All code is provided as proof of concept and for educational purposes. 

Note:
* Set list functionality incomplete
	* Currently only supports one beer set list at a time
